## Research Summary

My research specialises in innovating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mechanisms for clinical and research applications. Since my PhD, I have been one of the earliest pioneers in developing the Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) technique – a new imaging mechanism regarded as one of the most critical MRI technological breakthroughs in recent years. I am internationally recognised as a leading expert in this competitive field. 
 
By bringing together expertise in MR physics, signal processing and machine/deep learning, in the year 2020, I independently proposed a ground-breaking DECRA application that could revolutionise microscopic imaging techniques by breaking through the sub-millimetre image resolution, a bottleneck of current MRI methods. The project aims to change the current imaging practice in Australia and save tremendous amount of money for various research studies requiring tissue imaging.

In the last few years, I have also extended my research topics to novel acquisition and artificial intelligence methods for medical imaging. These include developing generative AI models for quantitative MRI reconstruction and analysis.
