# Research

**Themes:** Smart MRI • AI-guided acquisition • Physics-aware reconstruction • Portable/low-field MRI

## Current directions
- **QSM & iron mapping:** physics-informed models and deep generative reconstruction.
- **R2\* relaxometry:** robust mapping under reduced echoes and low SNR.
- **Portable MRI for stroke triage:** combining acquisition policies with efficient recon.

## Selected projects
- **QSMDiff:** Diffusion-based QSM inversion.
- **DeepRelaxo:** Fast, robust R2\* mapping under variable echoes.
- **DIP-UP:** Deep Image Prior for Phase Unwrapping.
